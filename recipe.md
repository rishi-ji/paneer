1- Add milk to a heavy bottom pan on medium heat.

2- Let the milk come to a boil, stir often so that it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.

3- Once the milk has come to a boil, turn off the heat and start adding vinegar (or lemon juice), little at a time.

4- At one point, the milk will curdle and you will see the whey separate. At that point, stop adding the curdling agent and wait for 5 minutes so that the milk curdles completely.

5- Drain the curdled milk into a muslin cloth.

6- Rinse the paneer with cold water so that the final paneer doesn’t have any taste of vinegar.

7- Bring the ends of muslin cloth together and squeeze as much water as you can.

8- Then flatten the paneer (wrapped inside the muslin cloth) and place it on a flat surface. Then place a heavy object on top for it to set.

I placed a plate and then placed mortar & pestle on top. Leave it undisturbed for 1 to 2 hours.

Once the paneer is set, remove it carefully from the muslin cloth and cut into cubes.

Use paneer in any of your favorite recipes like this butter paneer! Yum!
